# Research: Ethics in Group Projects and Education

## Responsibility

Our project group had a large responsibility this semester: not only was our own project depending on our work, but also that of two other groups from another university. When it comes to an individual project, you are only responsible for your own grades, but the bigger the group that uses your software, the more important it is to deliver high quality work.

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct says:

> “*The dignity of employers, employees, colleagues, clients, users, and anyone else affected either directly or indirectly by the work should be respected throughout the process. Computing professionals should respect the right of those involved to transparent communication about the project.” - (guideline 2.1)
> 

It can be easy to ignore a problem with for example the API, but the functioning of that API is essential for others to be able to continue working. Even when it’s not possible to fix the problem right away, we have a responsibility as a group to communicate clearly about our planned timeline. This is especially true when working together with groups from a different university: they have a different yearly schedule, and might have different working methods or deadlines, which could make something that doesn’t seem important to us very urgent in actuality. It’s important to listen well to what the other group says they need, and, if need be, adjust our own planning to accommodate. 

## Education

This responsibility towards others does bring another ethical discussion with it when you consider that our main goal with this project is to learn new things. In our group, there were those who already had experience using certain techniques we needed for the project, and the most efficient way of working would be to let them implement those techniques. We didn’t end up doing this, because we all wanted to learn as many new things as possible this semester. This does however clash slightly with the considerations discussed earlier - and guideline 2.6 of the ACM Code is “*Perform work only in areas of competence”*. If you start work in an area where you have no experience whatsoever, the project is at a greater risk of delays, which could negatively impact the other groups. The answer is good communication. Like guideline 2.6 says:

> “*If at any time before or during the work assignment the professional identifies a lack of a necessary expertise, they must disclose this to the employer or client.”*
> 

I think we handled this relatively well between our project groups: everyone was honest about what skills they did and did not possess, and when a technique still needed to be learned we made sure to indicate that and plan additional time. I think it helped that, despite the cultural differences, the groups from Finland and the Netherlands all consisted of students in a similar situation, who understood that learning new things was the main goal of the project.

The fact that learning is important is also supported by the ACM Code:

> “*Leaders should ensure that opportunities are available to computing professionals to help them improve their knowledge and skills in professionalism, in the practice of ethics, and in their technical specialties.”*  - (guideline 3.5)
> 

Although there was no single leader within our group, we did have a rotating scrum master who ensured that tasks were not only assigned to those who had the most relevant experience, but to those who were interested in gaining that experience.

The focus did lie mostly on technical skills, and less on communication or ethics. The latter were less directly needed for the project, but I think it could have been interesting to for example have a conversation around the privacy challenges concerning our application.

## Closing Words

Lastly, I want to mention that I am incredibly positive about the group project, and I’m very glad I participated. The eventual meeting with the groups from Finland was a lot of fun, and the project offered a good way to learn to work together in different ways. While there were many subtle cultural differences noticeable between the groups, there turned out to be more similarities in the end. The difference in lesson plans between the universities required the biggest adjustment, but I think we managed to make it relatively well, and ended up delivering a great end result.

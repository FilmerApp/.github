# Cooperation Between Cultures
It is increasingly common for software to be created with multicultural teams, parts of which might even be working from different countries, which means that you will have to work together with colleagues from potentially very different cultures, who might have a different way of working. This means it’s incredibly important to be able to recognize those cultural differences, and be able to adjust your way of working and communicating accordingly.

This semester, our group from Eindhoven worked together with multiple groups from Oulu, Finland on a software project. While Finland might seem culturally comparable to the Netherlands, there are always small differences that can greatly impact the way you cooperate. This is why I want to investigate what culture is, how they differ from one another, how they interact, and how you can make this interaction elapse more smoothly.

# Culture

In order to examine cultural differences, we first need to figure out what culture itself is. Unfortunately, it’s not very concrete, making it something that can be difficult to define, and people’s definitions of the word can vary wildly.

Most do agree that culture is some sort of system that governs the way a group of people lives together. This system is learned when we grow up, and taught to us by the society around us. This set of rules governs many things, most of them subtle enough to not immediately be noticed by outsiders, but most importantly they define what is and is not accepted in a group.

There are some obvious examples for things that almost no group finds acceptable (murder being one of them), but the difficulty arises mostly when it comes to smaller cases. For example, in many countries, including the Netherlands, giving someone a thumbs up is a sign of approval or acceptance. However, there are countries, like Greece and Italy, where that same sign is considered rude. Recognizing these difficulties can be incredibly difficult, and it can take people years and even lifetimes to fully adjust to an unknown culture.

Many of these ‘rules’ that our culture has set for us are so deeply ingrained within us that we often don’t even consciously register them until they are broken, we simply see them as the status quo, what is ‘normal’.

This is why it is incredibly important to not only examine other cultures in order to work with them (something I will investigate in more depth later) but also be aware of our own culture, and how it can interact and possibly conflict with others. This not only avoids potentially hurting others, but also allows you to better work together, which is essential when trying to finish a project with coworkers hailing from other cultures. Someone’s culture might alter the way they work, the way they make agreements, how much they value those agreements, their expectations of others, and many other things. Recognizing these differences could make the difference between a project succeeding and failing.

# Cultural Dimensions

In order to examine cultural differences, you first need a framework to define cultural characteristics. One of the most well-known if Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory. This model defines a country’s culture based on six dimensions, and based on research and surveys has rated these characteristics for many countries, allowing one to easily compare the similarities and differences in culture between them.

The six dimensions Hofstede established are Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Long Term Orientation, and Indulgence. Instead of defining and examining every single one of these, I want to focus on the ones that I believe to have been most important for our own cooperation with the groups from Oulu. I do want to preface this summation by saying that I generalize both countries’ cultures here, which might not always be appropriate; I go into more detail in the ‘Criticism’ section.

Firstly, Individualism; which determines if a society values its people looking out for themselves and being independent, over taking care of their entire group. Both Finland and the Netherlands score quite high in this category, but even then the Netherlands is quite a bit higher. This means that both teams will likely appreciate a certain degree of independence, and want to work together more because of a feeling of mutual advantage than loyalty to the group. Managing these groups would likely require a greater focus on individuals instead of the entire group at once. Due to the similarity between both countries, their working styles should fit together well for this specific dimension.

Secondly, Masculinity; a dimension which is a bit strangely named, but determines whether or not a society is driven by competition and success, with a lower (i.e. more feminine) score meaning that a culture values caring for others is more important than individual success and rising above the pack. When it comes to this dimension, Finland and the Netherlands are once again very similar: both score incredibly low, with the Netherlands being slightly lower this time.  This means that being supportive of each other, involving everyone, and ensuring a pleasant and equal working environment will most likely be valued by groups from both countries.

Lastly, Power Distance. This dimension determines power in a culture is distributed equally (crucially, from the point of view of those with less power). This is the dimension that Finland and the Netherlands are the closest in, both scoring relatively low. This is very important, especially when attempting to lead a project, as it is very likely group members will not appreciate someone exercising their power just because they have it. A leader might be necessary, but only to ensure the project runs well, and everyone expects to be treated as equals and be able to take part in the decision-making process.

As we can see, Finland and the Netherlands are actually very similar in most categories. There is one outlier: Long Term Orientation. Finland scores relatively low in this category, whereas for the Netherlands it is the other way around. This means that people from Finland tend to be more normative, and slightly more inclined to respect tradition. It also means they have a greater focus on short-term results than people from the Netherlands. This could be an important factor when it comes to larger projects, where long-term planning vs short-term results is an important consideration, but considering the relatively short duration of our own project I personally didn’t notice a lot of conflict.

One might assume that it is logical for countries that are geographically close to have similar cultural dimensions, but this is not always true: for example, while we established the Netherlands to score very low on masculinity, Belgium actually scores relatively high. This means investigating these dimensions on a case-by-case basis is very important.

# Critiques of the Hofstede Model

While I think the Hofstede model gives some interesting insights, and definitely makes you think about cultural differences in a more concrete way, I do have some criticisms.

First of all, the model offers a very high-level analysis. I don’t quite agree with the choice to measure the values by country. While I definitely do believe there are common factors within most countries, I also think that many have such a wildly varying culture that grouping them all together makes the model way less useful. I would be very interested to see, for example, the difference in the model between people from Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain - both part of the same country, but both areas with a very strong cultural identity. Another good example would be many countries in Africa, a region that will become more and more important within technological fields as the years progress. Due to the, to put it kindly, uninformed way the borders of many African countries were drawn, many contain a staggeringly large amount of different people, with wildly different cultures. Averaging all these cultures to fit a single model might not be nearly as useful as it sounds, and could even be hurtful.

I also think the way the original data for Hofstede’s model was gathered, by interviewing IBM employees in different countries, is problematic: a group of highly educated engineers is not very representative, and the way they view their own culture might differ greatly from the way other people from their country do. Obviously, we work with engineers, but even then I don’t think this is a valid way of gathering this data, as we see engineers from more and more different walks of life getting into the field nowadays.

Lastly, there is the issue of individualism. While the model might describe general trends in a country, that does not mean that a specific individual will have to conform to it. Assuming someone will prefer to work a certain way might be worse than making no assumptions at all.

All in all, I do think Hofstede’s model has value, but I do not think it should be used as a rule. Rather, it can serve as a vague guideline to prepare you for what to expect from a culture.

# Conclusion: working with different cultures

Like I said, knowing about cultural differences is essential, but I also believe it to be essential to keep an open mind, and not make assumptions about others. Especially when working together on a project, it is vital to discuss preferred working methods, keep asking questions, and be willing to adjust your own way of working to accommodate a different group.

Obviously, miscommunications, confusions, and errors are unavoidable, but you can try to minimize them by being aware of the differences between your own culture and that of others beforehand.

As a final remark, I want to say that interaction with different cultures not only gives rise to difficulties, but is also a great opportunity for learning. Instead of just seeing the other culture as something foreign that you need to interact with, it can give you new perspectives on things that you might have never considered, and could potentially even integrate within your own point of view.

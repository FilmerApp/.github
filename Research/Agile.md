# Kanban
Kanban is a simple agile working method built around the central pillar of a Kanban board. This is a board full of cards containing tasks (often with a short description of what that task entails) that can be assigned to different categories, for example *To Do, In Progress, Ready for Review,* and *Done*. Every card has a developer who is responsible for it, and as soon as it has been finished the next card can be taken from the top of the backlog. Often a limit is set on the amount of tasks that can be *In Progress* at the same time, ensuring every programmer has a greater focus on finishing a single task, instead of having to divide their attention across multiple.

Kanban doesn’t work with sprints, but offers continious progress and delivery, making sure every improvement ends up deployed as soon as possible. There is no central leader for this process (although there are exceptions where a leader is appointed), but every developer has a clear overview of what needs to be done, so they can easily choose what task they will be taking on next.

Because there is no sprint where progress can be discussed, the measure of team effectiveness is often not the amount of tasks that have been completed in a period of time, but the cyclus time: the average amount of time it takes to finish a task.

Kanban has many advantages: the board gives every developer a clear overview of the status of a project, and ensures everyone knows exactly what tasks still need to be done. If a limit is set on the amount of tasks that can be in progress, everyone will not just work on new features, but also be encouraged to do other jobs like reviewing each other’s code.

This flexibility could also be a downside however, as there is no central leader like a scrum-master who is responsible for the project, which means that every developer will have to take more responsibility in assigning themselves tasks and ensuring they get completed.

It’s also possible to mix Kanban with other agile working methods: for our own group project we used a sort of Kanban board, with cards divided in categories based on user stories. We did work in sprints, but every morning we had a standup where we looked at the board, discussed what tasks were completed, and assigned new ones to people who didn’t have anything to do.

Especially at the start of the semester, keeping the board updated took some getting used to, but in the end I think it turned out to be a very useful tool. The user stories being divided into multiple small tasks gave everyone a better grasp of the exact status of the project, and it was easy to identify possible bottlenecks.
